#  TrackFlow

TrackFlow is a lightweight project management and task tracking system (similar to Linear, but simpler).  
Built with **.NET 8**, it follows **Clean Architecture** principles to keep code maintainable, scalable, and testable.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

The solution is organized into four layers:

```

src/
├── TrackFlow\.Api             → ASP.NET Core Web API (entry point)
├── TrackFlow\.Application     → Application logic (services, use-cases, DTOs)
├── TrackFlow\.Domain          → Core domain models & business rules
├── TrackFlow\.Infrastructure  → EF Core, database, and external integrations

````

### ✅ Responsibilities
- **Domain**  
  Pure business models, entities, and core logic.  
  → No external dependencies.

- **Application**  
  Business use-cases, service layer, DTOs, interfaces.  
  → Depends only on **Domain**.

- **Infrastructure**  
  Implementation of persistence (EF Core repositories), database migrations, and 3rd-party integrations.  
  → Depends on **Domain**.

- **API**  
  ASP.NET Core controllers, request/response handling, Swagger, dependency injection setup.  
  → Depends on **Application** & **Infrastructure**.
